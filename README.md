# Nokia Jam 3 Game Outline
### By Coffee Break Studios and friend

## Nokia Game Jam Theme On/Off

Player is a sniper(bounty hunter) which goal is to take out the mark.
Setting city rooftop scoping out a building complex with several characters.
Matching the “image” of the mark; sniper takes them out.
Noted: The characters are active in the building, some rooms are dark and some rooms are not
Sniper needs to activate or deactivate their night vision googles in order to find their mark.

Zoom?, WASD to control scope movement, One Screen

In the game the player character begins at rooftop with bounty mark. The marked will be revealed until timer starts or until player presses [x] to begin. Another timer begins and zoomed scene appears.(?) Which then player has a few seconds to find the mark. Challenge is the marks interacting in building with lights on or off prompting player to activate goggles. Hit 10 in a row to unlock Hard Mode (faster timer?) and smaller scope.

If timer runs out scene prompts ‘Game Over’ Scene and may restart.

Game is to hit marks and you win.
